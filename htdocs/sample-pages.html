<div class="paragraph">
The following are samples of some NSFW projects I built. I've always hesitated
to include them in my portfolio, but I'm really quite proud of some of the work
here. Also, my wife tells me its lame of me to not post this work. As if I should
need to worry that it will reflect poorly on my professionalism. The first lady
has appeared in softcore porn, and a project manager I once collaborated with
who actually managed to shock <strong class="accent">ME</STRONG> with the number of times he 
said the word <strong class="accent">"Fuck"</strong> in a half hour meeting. 
Not necessarily knowing anything about the culture of the people under his 
management wasn't unemployed the last I saw activity on linkedin <strong class="accent">AND I AM</strong>, 
so clearly trying to keep up a clean professional appearance isn't helping me 
enough to be worth hiding behind a shield of run-of-the-mill conventionality. 
</div><div class="paragraph">

<strong class="accent">Fuck it!</STRONG>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<strong class="accent">And FUCK YOU IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT!</STRONG>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<strong class="highlight text-uppercase">If I spent 30 seconds interacting with each person on this planet, I would get kinda close, but I would not finish speaking to everyone in 100 years. In other words, I have not got time for people who don't like me exactly how I am.</STRONG>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<strong class="accent">... AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU!</STRONG>
</div><div class="paragraph">
<h3 class="text-xl mt-4"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205182255/http://www.bucketoffuck.com/">Bucket of Fuck TGP</a></h3>
The design on <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205182255/http://www.bucketoffuck.com/">bucketoffuck TGP</a> is, in my opinion, one of the more beautiful
creations for web I've made entirely on my own. Furthermore, though it is lost
to time, the code that I created to build that site was ahead of its time. 
</div><div class="paragraph">
In researching the project, I reached out to many of the big name sites of
the time (2006) and got a few of the webmasters to speak with me. Of particular
interest was a conversation I had with the creator of pichunter.
Something I said rubbed him the wrong way and he unloaded on me a massive 
criticism of the direction I was taking with development. 
</div><div class="paragraph">
At that time, and I'm not sure how it's done now, it might be somewhat the same, 
but back then paysites would provide affilliates with Free Hosted Galleries
and Asset packs that affiliates could use to create their own galleries. 
They would host on their own site (and pay for the bandwidth) I had 
initially set out to sort the Free Hosted Galleries so those with the highest 
resolution images would show up first. I used a curl command to request just 
the http headers describing the file without downloading an entire image as I 
only wanted to store a number representing the filesize of a random
image in the gallery. I setup a webform where I would select the niche and paste a 
list of links to Free Hosted Galleries. My script would run through them all 
checking to ensure no galleries were submitted twice, and run my curl script to 
get a numeric value representing the filesize of a random image in the gallery. 
</div><div class="paragraph">
As you can imagine this didn't work out all that well. There turned out to be a 
large number of galleries that were made from video screenshots that had filesizes 
of 0.3-0.5MB, among the largest filesizes for images in the Free Hosted Galleries. 
I dealt with it by excluding such galleries from my import, but I never really 
found a better way to achieve what I had hoped to achieve. 
</div><div class="paragraph">
Back to the  criticism I received of my development. I initually built the 
site using Macromedia's Coldfusion because, at the time, it was the web scripting 
language I was most familiar with having used it at my first real job 
after graduating from college. I honestly never looked into the benchmarks 
for coldfusion vs other languages, but according to the critique I received 
this was the absolute most ridiculous decision I could have made and would 
certainly result in the total failure of my project if I ever managed to 
get enough traffic to my site to make it profitable. I would need to use 
PHP if I should have any hope of suceess. (and really there was no hope for me as
I was a "stupid american" evienced by the sheer idiocy of my question). 
He then went on at length about how much traffic porn sites needed to be able to 
handle to be profitable vs. other types of websites and then talked about castle
in Czecheslovkia he purchased with the money he made building pichunter and how he
made it his top priority to leave this terrible country (USA) as quickly as
possible. 
</div><div class="paragraph">
The conversation left a pretty strong impression on me. This webmaster had this 
huge-asshole personality. And, to be honsest, this is really not uncommon among 
devs of his age group which I estimated to be Gen-X, but he was right 
about a lot of stuff. I was going  to figure out the least load intensive way
to serve pages possible. The  first thing I figured to do was instead of 
dynamically generating the pages  when a visaitor made a request, 
I would pregenerate my pages. I only really  needed to  regenerate the site 
content every few hours, not on every page load. So I set down and created a program,
in Java this time, that would generate pages for each of the niche 
categories, a home page, a page of video galleries from mixed categories, 
a page image galleries from mixed categories, a page of image galleries sorted 
from largest decending with, I think, a lower bound, and then a random sort... 
</div><div class="paragraph">
I have no idea... you get the idea though. In totall, my script would generate
around 100 pages full of gallery links and store them as html. Each time I 
ran the script, it would randomize the links on the page. Further, I set 
dates for galleries I imported to begin appearing  so entirely new content 
would appear among the links. So, in a way, here in 2006 I created a 
static site generator. And I'm honestly suprised these didn't begin showing 
up much sooner because the utility is clear. 
</div><div class="paragraph">
But I still felt more could 
be done. What could I do to further decrease  the load required to serve 
one of my gallery pages? I clicked a link and heard the sound come out of 
the development server I had converted my old computer into. 
It was the sound of a magnetic disk seeking and reading. Yes. I asked a 
developer friend if he knew a way to get apache to preload my website content 
into memory so it could serve pages directly from memory. My entire site build 
was far smaller than the memory available on my dev server and  my production server. 
There wasn't a configuration option in apache, but it was possible to mount a 
portion of the system memory as a <Strong>ramdisk</strong>. So I did just that. 
And I wish I'd run benchmarks  and stored the reults to share, but I didn't. 
</div><div class="paragraph">
There's lots I didn't know to do back then, but all the same I'm very proud of 
what I <strong>DID</strong> think to do so early on in my web development education.
</div>

<h3 class="text-xl mt-4"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120107133502/https://noarmy.com/">NoArmy.com</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
It's no secret that I'm a hard leftist. So, no, I don't support the US occupation of... anywhere.
And to me, supporting the troops means helping them to realize how they are being
manipulated into risking their lives and mental health for a scam. One day at work, a
friend of mine sent me a link to the GoArmy.com website and asked, "hey, do you know
how to write actionscript, what do you think about reverse engineering this thing?"
I didn't really know actionscript (the language to code flash objects interactivity), 
but I'm versatile. Before I even began to search for a decompiler, I opened up web 
devloper and viewed the network activity that occured when I clicked on various parts 
of the homepage flash. It was too damn easy. This flash video was reading an XML file. 
I downloaded a mirror of the webpage, recreated the xml file and began making edits.
</div><div class="paragraph">
too much fun!.
</div><div class="paragraph">
I wonder is "noarmy.com" available?
</div><div class="paragraph">
nope
</div><div class="paragraph">
who is the owner, email them. show them what we have.
</div><div class="paragraph">
message sent.
</div><div class="paragraph">
the next day we received a response
</div><div class="paragraph">
"I bought this domain like a decade ago hoping to do something what you've done here, 
sure send me the ip address where you're hosting it, I'll point the domain There.
</div><div class="paragraph">
And so it remained for several years until the novelty faded. Now the page reads 
"Something new is coming" so maybe another generation has taken on the task of outdoing 
our attempt at culture jamming the US army recruitment site :).
