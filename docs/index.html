   <section class="m-4 contact-section">

	Hello, my name is Rick Pfahl. Presumably you know me and that's what has
	landed you here. 
	
	<br/><br/>
	You might be looking for my contact information:

	<br/><br/>
	
	<strong>rather than just pasting it on the web for everyone and all the
	spambots to see. I ask that you send an email to 
	<a href="mailto:contact@rickpfahl.com">contact@rickpfahl.com</a>
	with your name and preferred method of contact, I'll contact you directly 
	with my phone numbers and email address.
	
	<br/><br/>
	I prefer to communicate using <a target="_blank" href="https://signal.org">Signal</a>
	an app that uses and makes an encrypted messaging protocol accessible
	to non-technical users.</strong>, but I also monitor my cellphone
	and my primary email account.
	
	<br/><br/>
    In other words, here is the list of contact methods I check
	regularly in order of how closely I monitor them:
    <div class="p-4 bg-lighter ">
	<ol>
	<li>Signal Messages (I have accounts associated with both cell numbers)<li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Calls/SMS</span> to my primary cell number
	(<span class="accent">+1***-667-****</span>).</li> 
	<li><span class="highlight">e-mail</span> to my personal email address.
	(<span class="accent">p*****@*********</span>).</li>
	<li><span class="highlight">Calls/SMS</span> to my secondary number.
	(<span class="accent">+1***-525-****</span>).</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
	
	I recently lost access to my original Facebook account, and it pains me 
	that I should even need to mention this, but I know there are people
	who only know how to contact me through facebook. Now it should also
	be possible to google my name to find this page and point of contact.  
	<span class="highlight uppercase">BTW. PLEASE STOP USING FACEBOOK THAT 
	WAY, YOU'RE FORCING PEOPLE TO USE A SERVICE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE 
	OTHERWISE CHOSEN NOT TO DUE TO A MULTITUDE OF ETHICAL CONCERNS AND 
	THIS IS PRECISELY WHY THEY ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATING IN THIS MANNER 
	WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE</span>
	
	<br/><br/>

	I've made it a point to maintain access to the same cellphone number
	since 2006, so if you have that number... you can still contact me
	that way. I also use some other communication technology such as
	xmpp and matrix, but I'm not presently using those enough to tell
	you that I can reliably be contacted through them. I'll get your
	message eventually, but it could be weeks or months, so until that
	changes I refer everyone to the above.
